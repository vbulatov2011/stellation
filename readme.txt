This is source code of the stellation applet. 
The applet and the source web site is: 
http://www.physics.orst.edu/~bulatov/polyhedra/stellation_applet/

The source code is indented for people, who wish to modify or extend the applet 
functionality. It is not needed to run the applet. 

To build the applet, you need to have java JDK installed on your system. 

makeall.bat on Windows system will compile everything and create 
executable stellation.jar file. 

Several people's work was used in the applet code. 
In particular, 
Fmt package by Jef Poskanzer, 
Math expression parser by Darius Bacon, 
Jama matrix package by Jama team, 
Paul Prants helped to extended incomplete Symmetry class. 

I apologize if I've forgot somebody.
